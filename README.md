## Section 2: Poster

The `poster` folder contains the poster presentation for this project. This provides a visual summary of our research work, methodology, and key findings.

## Section 3: Checkpoint Folder

Due to space constraints, we have only provided the checkpoints for Audio MNIST in the `checkpoint` folder. These trained models can be used for validation.

We can provide checkpoints for other datasets upon request.

## Section 4: Report

The `report` folder contains the complete technical report in CVPR format as requested. This report includes detailed information about the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions of our research.
